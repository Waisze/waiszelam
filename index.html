								<p>When I'm not experimenting around with a new project, you can usually catch me training to run 10k, making belgium waffles or bundled up in a ball of blankets.</p><br>
								<p>I also enjoy playing tennis with my siblings, skiing with friends and scouting out that new restaurant down the street.</p><br>
								<p>I love travelling! From Edinburgh to Varadero, encountering new cultures, faces and amazing views is something I always look forward to.</p>

								<p>Looking to apply the knowledge I had gained from OEC2012, I was granted a two year internship at IBM.</p><br>
								<p>My job here was to handle front-end web development of responsive UIs for e-commerce store models. I gained valuable experience when building products for massive audiences; supporting for many devices, browsers and languages was essential.</p>

								<p>The Ontario Engineering Competition 2012 is a annual provincial event between engineering universities. It was also my first professional foray into web development!</p><br>
								<p>My responsibilies as the Vice Chair of Communications meant that I oversaw outgoing messages and managed the official competitions website.</p><br>
								<p>I learned a lot about web design and development during my one year stay at OEC2012, and I attribute my passion and drive as a web developer to this experience.</p>

								<p>My second hackathon!</p><br>
								<p>Hosted by a Toronto-based telecommunications company, my team was given 24 hours to create an application that utilized their chat API. Our product, named FreeLancr, provided a one-click customer support solution that provided SME and freelancers with a platform in order engage with potential customers using live chat without a dedicated support team.</p><br>
								<p>We aimed to complete a full, marketable product that solved a real-world problem and it paid off. Our team won First Place at the competition, and were rewarded with two Google Glasses!</p><br>

								<p>Not too long ago, I decided to apply what I had learned as a web developer into making a personal website. What is a web developer without his own website, after all?</p><br>
								<p>In the end, I came up with a simple responsive design that I felt was visually appealing and properly representative of an interactive resume.</p><br>

								<p>Hackathons are a really good way to kick yourself into high gear. With only a limited amount of time and a ton of coffee, you can find yourself building amazing applications in no time.</p><br>
								<p>For this NASA themed hackathon, my team and I coded a virtual reality satellite tracker. Created using Unity3D, Blender, and the Oculus Rift, it allows the user to view their surroundings from the perspective of multiple satellites, including the ISS and the moon.</p><br>
								<p>Take a look!</p><br>
